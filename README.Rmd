# textfeatureinfor

## **Description**


In Natural Language Processing, it is common for users to try and engineer their own features from a given text. It can be difficult to extract certain features from text without using additional R tools. This R package includes functions that allows data scientists to extract information from text features which can be useful for feature engineering, or in other data science projects. Our package, textfeatureinfor, will help gather summary information from plain text such as the number of punctuations in the text, the average word lengths and the percentage of fully capitalised words which can be useful information for feature engineering. Additionally, our package can also manipulate text data by removing the stopwords for the ease of future processing steps. 

Our package and functions are inspired from a lab in the course, DSCI 573 (Feature and model selection), of UBC MDS program, and are tailored based on our own experience and interest. 

## **Function Details**

- `count_punc`: This function will count and return the number of punctuations within a given text.
- `avg_word_len`: This function will calculate and return the average length of words within a given text.
- `perc_cap_words`: This function will calculate the percentage of fully capitalised words in the text.
- `remove_stop_words`: This function will find and remove the stop words in a text and will return the list of clean words.

## Installation

You can install the development version of textfeatureinfor from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/textfeatureinfor")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(textfeatureinfor)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
