The library `textfeatureinfor` has for functions, one of which is `remove_stop_words`. Here we will explore the usage of this function.

```{r setup}
library(textfeatureinfor)
```

We can pass a piece of text to this function. The function will remove all the stopwords and return a clean vector of all non-stopwords in the text.

```{r}
remove_stop_words("Tomorrow is a big day!")
```

This function is helpful in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. Before applying any machine learning procedures, we can preprocess the data by removing all the stopwords.
